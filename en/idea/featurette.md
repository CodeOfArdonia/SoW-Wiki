# Featurette

- Featurette on skins, talk about extrusions, why we chose not to use them.
- Featurette on script. Show process. Original drafts that sucked. Talk about how elder Ardoni don’t use contractions. Custom scripting technique. Names (Felina ending in –a or –I, Magnorites having "O and G sounds" and the story of Igneous’ name being Igneo initially) Ardoni being Greek/Roman/Latin (Perseus, Theseus, etc)) Clan names end in "-is"， provinces in "-ia" and song categories in "-ium"
- Featurette on music for sure. Show lot of early song ideas. Explain how 
Get Gyazo Pro, go through all my old gyazos lol, find a bunch of old stuff. 
Show how the world came to be
- In per-episode featurettes, can even break those down into a few sections related to that episode. Like the episode 2 featurette would have "making of Ardonia" or something if it didn’t need it’s full featurette.
- Cinematic flyovers.
- Building featurette. Talk about how it’s one big world.
- Enchantments? How they’re all unique
- Songs might deserve it’s own one too. I have all those temp stuff, different iterations.
- Wanted to give the sense of scale when arriving in Oakendale, the first major city we really get to see. Had the Iron Golem pass the camera right away to show that the characters are a lot smaller in a much bigger world, with bigger things out there and stuff. Magnorite carrying anvil to show they are strong. There was a line about how Magnorites are aggressive and dangerous, took it out, made it more mysterious, less literal. 
- Play MNOLG
- Scroll through memes of war chat together and laugh at old dumb stuff. 
- Gotta do a reaction compilation, maybe for specific moments like character deaths, season endings, etc.
- If talking about Season 1 as a whole and where it leaves off, it basically leaves off with everything in disarray. Kingdoms aren’t united and Felden is now occupied with Necromancers, Ardoni hesitatant to do anything, they sent their only army and it failed, Enderknights don’t exist, and in all this armies are rising on multiple sides. Voltaris are returning, Necromancers are rising. 
- Make a video of map which shows character movement in realtime, maybe shows the scenes in the top corner.
