# Jaggathan

*(Jag-uh-thenn)*

- One of the most dangerous species, and best physical fighters. 
- They rank up biologically as they fight and kill. If they don’t rank up every 15 or so years, they die, killing off the weaker ones. Their suffix is given to them based on their rank (-a, -arn, -arius, -arion) 
- First level has just fins drawn on. Second level fins turn into nubs. Third level they’re actual fins. Fourth level they get little lights on them. 
- Often are more badass than Magnorites, not as physically resistant. Much more rare. Nicknamed Jags.
