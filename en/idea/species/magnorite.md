# Magnorite

*(Mag-nur-ites)*

- Magnorites aren’t organic. They begin as simply an ore-like block. When mixed with lava, they are “born.” They run on the lava energy which birthed them and runs through them. Because of this, they do not sleep nor eat, but they burn through their lifetime very quickly and tend to live only around 15-25 years. They are fire and lava resistant, and fairly tough against arrows and swords. Don’t like cold, can’t swim (partially due to their heavy weight.) Weakness to pickaxes. Some of the older ones can have some moss on them just to distinguish and make them a bit more decorated. 
- They’re very much a sheep species, doing whatever the majority of surrounding Magnorites do. They like to all act and behave the same. Because of this, the K’arthen Magnorites have been stuck with an aggressive and confrontational attitude for the past few generations, and ushering in change is extremely difficult.
