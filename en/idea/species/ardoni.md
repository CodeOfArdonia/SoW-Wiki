# Ardoni (both singular and plural)

- Ardoni used to be the primary species of Ardonia, but after the Great War many were hunted and killed by the Deathsinger. Due to their long generation time and few females, their species has never fully recovered.
- Ardoni have long lifespans, up to around 250 years. This means there are still a few Ardoni who were alive in the time of the Great War which took place around 100 years ago.  
- Ardoni are the only species able to wield the songs of power naturally. They believe in balance and peace, and donâ€™t expand or develop much industry. They are great warriors when the time comes, both with songs and traditional swords and weapons.
- The Ardoni are a very clan-driven species, which is often difficult to understand for humans. They inherit the last name of their clan, and have no unique family names. Females are much less common than males, and thus they are regarded with much greater respect and power. Each family inherits visual markings from their mother, which is a way to determine Ardoni of the same clan. All brothers of a family generation have the same voice, as with sisters of a generation.
