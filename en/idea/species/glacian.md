This species is a fairly quiet and soft-spoken species. They have the longest lifespan of all- maximum age unknown, but only if they stay in the cold environment or they’ll start melting. Because of this, the entire species lives in the north where it’s cold. Many of them are historians, chroniclers, and record-keepers. It was they who created and look after the Walls of Time.
